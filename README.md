## Installation Options

### Option 1: Pre-built Package (Recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/SpyrosLefkaditis/Outlook-Linux/releases/tag/v1.0) and download the latest `outlook-app.deb`.

2. Open a terminal in the folder where you downloaded the file and run:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i outlook-app.deb
```

### Option 2: Source Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run the installer script:

```bash
cd Outlook-Linux
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Set up the application with proper permissions
- Create a desktop entry with Outlook icon
- Add the app to your application menu
- Install to your user directory (~/.local)

## Usage

After installation, you can:

1. **From Application Menu**: Search for "Outlook Linux" in your application launcher
2. **From Command Line**: Run `outlook-linux` (if ~/.local/bin is in your PATH)
3. **Pin to Taskbar**: Right-click the Outlook icon when running and pin it

The application will appear with the Outlook icon and behave like a native Linux application, separate from your regular Chrome browser.

## Troubleshooting

**Chrome/Chromium not found**: The app will automatically detect Chrome, Chromium, or Chromium-browser. If none are installed, it will fall back to your default browser.

**Icon not showing**: Make sure the `outlook.png` file is in the same directory as the script and run `./install.sh` again.

**Window still shows Chrome icon**: Try logging out and back in, or restart your desktop environment for the window manager to recognize the new application class.
